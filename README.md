# ETH-Computer-Vision


## Assignment 1
This assignment tests the basing understanding of simple Neural Network architectures (Multi-Layer-Perceptron and CNNs). It also helps familiarizing with PyTorch modules and framework. In the first of the two tasks, we are asked to classify points which are not linearly separable. We notice how the MLP outperrforms a simple linear classifier. In the second task, we are asked to implement a basic CNN network to classify the MNIST digits.

## Assignment 2
This assignment is split in two parts. In the first one, we are asked to manually implement the Mean Shift Unsupervised learning algorithm for image segmentation. In the second one, the goal was to built from scratch the SegNet architecture, both the encoder and the decoder structure.
