# Assignment 1
This assignment tests the basing understanding of simple Neural Network architectures (Multi-Layer-Perceptron and CNNs). It also helps familiarizing with PyTorch modules and framework. In the first of the two tasks, we are asked to classify points which are not linearly separable. We notice how the MLP outperrforms a simple linear classifier. In the second task, we are asked to implement a basic CNN network to classify the MNIST digits.
