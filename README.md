# ETH-Computer-Vision


## Assignment 1
This assignment tests the basing understanding of simple Neural Network architectures (Multi-Layer-Perceptron and CNNs). It also helps familiarizing with PyTorch modules and framework. In the first of the two tasks, we are asked to classify points which are not linearly separable. We notice how the MLP outperrforms a simple linear classifier. In the second task, we are asked to implement a basic CNN network to classify the MNIST digits.

## Assignment 2
This assignment is split into two parts. In the first one, we are asked to manually implement the Mean Shift Unsupervised learning algorithm for image segmentation. In the second one, the goal was to built from scratch the SegNet architecture, both the encoder and the decoder structure.

## Assignment 3
Assignement 3 tests the understanding of the principles of Camera Calibration and of the Strcture From Motion range imaging technique. In the first task, we first estimate the projection matrix P, with the Gold-Standard Algorithm. Then, using QR decomposition, we can obtain the intrinsic parameters of the calibration matrix and the extrinsic parameters: rotation matrix and translation vector. The second task is the development of a simple SFM algorithm, where we are asked to estimate successive camera poses with the triangulation technique.
